# Tic Tac Toe
This is a tic tac toe playing computer program made by Alex Malcolm while attending We Can Code IT.

## Plans
I've got to test out the base cases for the recursion class that will decide winning moves. I've got to get a good user interface working. I've got to make a class of the game, it should have a map containing the info of the board, with another class that is just each spot.
